# primodality_generator
Takes primes as input to generate primodal .scl files.

**Primodality** is a new category of digital harmony space conceived of by [Zheanna Erose]. This [lecture by Zheanna] explains it in detail.

A unique primodal scale exists for every conceivable positive prime. *n*-primodality is the set of all rational numbers where the denominator is positive prime *n* and the integer numerator *a* is greater than or equal to *n*. Particularly of interest is the subset where n â‰¤ a < 8n, which always contains a [just fifth]. This is the range for which this program produces a [.scl file], a flexible format made by Manuel Op de Coul of the [Huygens-Fokker Foundation] for use with [Scala].

Scala files are broadly but not universally supported by synthesizers and other computer music software. If you're interested in playing with these sounds, one prominent synthesizer with great .scl support is [Surge]. If you're interested in learning more about alternative tunings, a good place to start is the [Xenharmonic Wiki].

This program is run via command line. It accepts primes greater than 2 that fit in an unsigned 32-bit integer. I've produced a portable linux binary which can be found in the builds directory. If you have any questions, feel free to file an issue!

USAGE:

    primodality_generator-linux-1.1 [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [input]

FLAGS:

    -h, --help       Prints help information

    -p, --poly       Permits nonprime denominators.

    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:

    -f, --from <from>    Sets the minimum numerator as a factor of n.

                         Valid values are 0-254. Default value is 1. [default: 1]

    -t, --to <to>        Sets the maximum numerator as a factor of n.

                         Valid values are 1-255. Default value is 8. [default: 8]

ARGS:

    <input>    Sets denominator directly, skipping the menu.
